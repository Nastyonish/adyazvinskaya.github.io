                    <p>Fitt's Law states the the longer the distance and the smaller the target's size, 
                        the longer it takes. On this site we see large enough buttons that the user can 
                        easily and quickly press.</p>

                    Neuralink

                    <p>Proximity helps to illustrate relationships among objects through the distance between them. 
                        On this site we see that title, paragraph and two buttons are related. But these objects 
                        together are a separate entity relative to the next title.</p>

                    <img src = "images-principles/PARC-Contrast.png" alt = "PARC: Contrast - blueorigin.com">
                    <p>Contrast compels the observer to notice important detail within the work through size, 
                        color, or cintent contrast. On this site we see the color contrast between background 
                        and text color. Through this we concentrate on the text and options.</p>

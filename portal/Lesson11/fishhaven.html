                    <h2>Free Fishing Day</h2>
                    <p>While fishing has served to feed civilization since near the dawn 
                        of time, and in modern days it is a major industry that has a yearly 
                        yield in the billions of dollars, Go Fishing Day is dedicated to 
                        sport fishing, as well as those who fish as part of survival 
                        (known as subsistence fishing). Fishing is a great way to help 
                        add food to your table while having the satisfaction of knowing 
                        that you caught it yourself, as well as a wonderful bonding 
                        opportunity for friends and family. While the most common forms of 
                        fishing are rod and reel fishing, fly fishing, and at a distant 
                        third bow-fishing, there are many other forms that are practiced 
                        around the world for survival and pleasure. Whatever your preferred 
                        method, fishing is a great experience and gets us back in touch 
                        with nature and ourselves. Contrary to popular belief, fishing is 
                        far more than “One jerk waiting for another jerk at the end of the 
                        line.”, and instead is actually a result of luck combined with three 
                        important processes, the state of the fish, how it encounters the 
                        tackle, and the composition of that tackle.</p>

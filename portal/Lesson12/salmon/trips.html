                        wildest playgrounds.  Comparable in size and volume to the 
                        Colorado River and the Grand Canyon, the opportunities to 
                        challenge yourself are nearly boundless. The level of 
                        adventure you choose is limited only by your imagination 
                        and appetite.

                                    River before it joins the mighty Snake River on its 
                                    way to the Columbia. On this section of river, the 
                                    trip covers 53 miles on the Salmon River plus another 
                                    21 miles on the Snake River. Along the way, we float 
                                    through four different canyons named Green, Cougar, 
                                    Snowhole and Blue.

                                <p>Flowing untamed through a land so rugged that any 
                                    attempts at settlement have failed, the Middle Fork 
                                    of the Salmon River is truly a legend among the 
                                    whitewater rivers of the world. Traces of man's attempts to settle the area 
                                    remain as dilapidated log cabins, while more ancient 
                                    cultures left their marks in prehistoric cave paintings. 
                                    Enjoy more than 100 Idaho whitewater rafting rapids, 
                                    fishing in clear alpine waters, relaxation in natural hot

                                    memories along the way. Calm sections and deep pools 
                                    perfect for relaxing, swimming, and simply absorbing the 
                                    country's splendor. You'll enjoy sandy camping beaches 
                                    backed up to pine forests and granite mountains. Here, 
                                    wildlife abounds and rock paintings left by ancient 
                                    inhabitants still exist. Homestead cabins dot the riverway, 
                                    and some are still occupied today, made accessible by 
                                    private jetboat and/or private plane.

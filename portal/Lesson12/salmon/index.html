                            <h2>The Salmon River</h2>
                            <p>The Salmon River is also known as "The River of 
                                No Return". The Salmon is a popular destination 
                                for whitewater kayaking, canoeing, and rafting. 
                                The canyons of the Salmon allow for magnificent 
                                views of the complex geology of the region. The 
                                Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area 
                                includes one of the deepest canyons in the 
                                continental United States, which at roughly 7,000 
                                feet (2,130 m) of vertical relief, is deeper than 
                                the Grand Canyon. Outdoor Lodges dot the main 
                                canyon of the Salmon River from Salmon, Idaho to 
                                Riggins, Idaho. Often the only way to access these 
                                lodges is either by motorized boats, rafting trips, 
                                hiking, and even some isolated airstrips.
                            </p>
                            <p>The South Fork of the Salmon flows through Payette 
                                National Forest and enters the Wild and Scenic Main 
                                Fork at Mackay Bar. The Main Fork raft trip ends 
                                about 25 miles (40 km) east of Riggins, either at 
                                Vinegar Creek or Carey Creek, marking the beginning 
                                of the Lower Salmon rafting section.

                        <p>Idaho's Salmon River is divided by name into different 
                            sections, namely the Main Salmon, the Middle Fork of the 
                            Salmon River and the Lower Salmon. Any section of the Salmon 
                            River rafting is perfect for your family or group getaway 
                            with a great mixture of fun rapids, calm floats, great 
                            swimming and peaceful camping. Each of these trips offers 
                            a very unique setting from one another. Just because they 
                            call it the "River of No Return" doesn't mean you shouldn't!

                        <h2>Rafting the River of No Return</h2>
                        <p>The Salmon River truly caters to all levels of river runner, 
                            beckoning with options that run from wild to inviting, 
                            stimulating to relaxing and everything in between. This is 
                            the ideal trip for the greenhorn to the expert whether it 
                            be a gathering of friends, a young family, or a 
                            multi-generational group. Running the Salmon is an 
                            experience, which will forge bonds and create memories that 
                            will last a lifetime. For anyone seeking to disconnect from 
                            the world and reconnect with nature and the closest of 
                            friends and family, the Salmon River stands as the benchmark 
                            of adventure on one of the premier wilderness rivers on earth.
